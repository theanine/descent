The Stalker is an authority on traps and lures and excels at hastily constructing deadly contraptions to poison, explode, or otherwise incapacitate her unwary foes. As a class its main feature is the laying of trap tokens through the terrain, and skills that interact with them. The Stalker starts with a Trap Token supply (6). Each time the Stalker uses an ability that places one Trap Token, she takes one from the supply and places it on the map. Trap Tokens do not block movement or line of sight. Through strategic placement of traps, she influences a wide area providing advantages to attacks. Progression provides further benefits to attacks as well as searching, recovering fatigue, gaining surges and even health and stamina."><a href="http://wiki.descent-community.org/Watchman" class="class"><div class="divImage"><img src="classes/generic_healer_scout.png" class="class"><div class="className hybrid">Watchman<br>Stalker</div>H</div></a></span></td>

The Skirmisher is light and fast, but still capable of dealing out damage. While some Warriors perform best when given one enormous weapon, the Skirmisher excels with a weapon in each hand -- he defines dual-handed proficiency with incredible speed and the deadliest strikes. Even the overlord&#39;s most powerful minions will quickly learn to fear the speed and power of the Skirmisher. This class focuses on bonuses for attacking with one handed weapons and additional movement. Progression provides matchless speed and lethal killing efficiency with his two one-handed weapons."><a href="http://wiki.descent-community.org/Battlemage" class="class"><div class="divImage"><img src="classes/generic_mage_warrior.png" class="class"><div class="className hybrid">Battlemage<br>Skirmisher</div>M</div></a></span></td>

The Bard uses his melody and harmony tokens to trigger a vast array of beneficial effects. Almost all skills have two effects â€“ one if the melody token is on the card and the other if the harmony token is on the card. By changing his song, the Bard can trigger new abilities in the heat of battle, making sure that the heroes always have the inspiration they need to triumph over the overlord. Through the majesty of song, the Bard recovers fatigue and heals fellow party members. Progression enhances the potency of the music for not only support to the party but also to the detriments of enemies.

<td class="class"><span title="The Steelcaster is an expert at protecting themselves and their compatriots, willing to take massive amounts of damage to protect the other heroes in their party. Importantly, the Steelcaster can do what no other class can do, which is using powerful Runes with highly defensive Heavy Armor. The Steelcaster can extend this protection to his fellow heroes through his magical powers, from a distance.
The Runemaster&#39;s playstyle revolves around enhancing the attacks made by a rune weapon, like gaining blast or surge bonuses. Through the use of his magic rune, he deals heavy damage with great potential to pierce armor and progress to levels of even greater damage and wide area effects that damage multiple targets."><a href="http://wiki.descent-community.org/Steelcaster" class="class"><div class="divImage"><img src="classes/generic_warrior_mage.png" class="class"><div class="className hybrid">Steelcaster<br>Runemaster</div>W</div></a></span></td>
